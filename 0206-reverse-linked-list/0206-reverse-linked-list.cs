/*  Explaination 

    null   1    2 
    prev  Head  nextNode

it then becomes like this at the end of the while 

    null   1    2 
         prev  nextNode
                Head
                
    check !!! => while (head != null) âœ”
    
      1    2       3 
    prev  Head  nextNode   
    
    ==> this is after the first line in the while that moves
        the nextNode reference.


and at the end it will be like the following 

       4    5       null 
    prev  Head  nextNode 
    
      4    5      null 
          prev   nextNode
                  Head

    check !!! => while (head != null) xxx
    
    note: This why it was useful to make the check before
            moving the nextNode pointer, 
            because if we did not, we would be accessing 
            memory that is not ours
            
            ** this would happen if we were using actual pointers
                like in C/C++ , but here we use references.
